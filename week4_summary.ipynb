    "The following is about the *mutable* implementation of the previous `Conc` tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ConcBuffer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ConcBuffer` appends elements into an array of size $k$\n",
    "* When the array gets full, it's stored into a `Chunk` node and added to `Conc-tree`\n",

    "```scala\n",
    "class ConcBuffer[T: ClassTag](val k: Int, private var conc: Conc[T]) {\n",
    "    private var chunk: Array[T] = new Array(k)\n",
    "    private var chunkSize: Int = 0\n",

    "If the `chunk` is full, we `expand` and push the array into the `Conc-tree`\n",

    "### Chunk node:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Chunk` node is similar to `Single` node, but instead of a single element, they hold an array of elements\n",
